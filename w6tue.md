Current Assets - Current Liabilities 
- excess resources company will have available for operations (at a point in time)

### Current Ratio

Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- short term debt/obligation paying ability
- For every dollar of short term debt/obligation, what is the level of short term asset coverage?
- Declining ratio 
  - may be sign of deteriorating financial condition
  - might result from eliminating obsolete inventories

![](images/2023-05-09-12-10-25.png)

Average **Days to Collect Receivables** (aka **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**)

Average **Collection Period** = 365 Days / Acounts Receivable **Turnover**

- How many days it takes to collect the average amt of accounts receivable based on a year
  - Theoretically, collects accounts receivables every X days

### Inventory Ratio

Inventory **Turnover** = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

- How many times a company's average inventory has been sold and replaced during the year

![](images/2023-05-09-12-14-45.png)

Average **Days to Sell Inventory**

Average **Sales Period** = 365 Days / Inventory **Turnover**

## 4. Calculate ratio for assessing a company's solvency
