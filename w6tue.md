**Vertical** analysis: percentages to compare individualcomponents of financial statements to a **key statement figure**

## 2. Explain ratio analysis

Studying various relationships b/w diff items reported in a set of financial statements

Allows us to analyze the financials of one company
- for diff time periods 
- compare against other companies/industries

## 3. Calculate ratio for assessing a company's liquidity

Measures(noun) and ratios indicate co ability to pay short-term debts.

Can they cover their curr obligations?

Focus on current assets/liabilities

### Working Capital

Current Assets - Current Liabilities 
- excess resources company will have available for operations (at a point in time)
- "cushion" against short-term debt-paying challenges

### Current Ratio

Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- short term debt/obligation paying ability
- For every dollar of short term debt/obligation, what is the level of short term asset coverage?
- Declining ratio 
  - may be sign of deteriorating financial condition
  - might result from eliminating obsolete inventories

### Quick Ratio (Acid-Test)

Quick Assets / Current Liabilities

Quick Assets
- Cash
- Current Marketable Securities
- Accounts Receivables

> Essentially excludes Inventory

Measures company's ability to meet obligation without having to liquidate/sell inventory

What is your coverage if you rely on cash on hand and potential collections?

### Accounts Receivable Ratios

Accounts Receivable **Turnover** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivabl

- Measure of collection efficiency

- How many times a company converts (collects) it's receivables into cash each year (on average)

![](images/2023-05-09-12-10-25.png)

Average **Days to Collect Receivables** (aka **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**)

Average **Collection Period** = 365 Days / Acounts Receivable **Turnover**

- How many days it takes to collect the average amt of accounts receivable based on a year
  - Theoretically, collects accounts receivables every X days

### Inventory Ratio

Inventory **Turnover** = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

- How many times a company's average inventory has been sold and replaced during the year

Average **Days to Sell Inventory**

Average **Sales Period** = 365 Days / Inventory **Turnover**

- How many days it takes to sell the invetory (on average)
  - Theoretically, inventory sold and replenished every X days

## 4. Calculate ratio for assessing a company's solvency

Used to analyze LONG TERM 
- debt/obligation-paying ability
- capital structure

### Debt to Assets Ratio

**Debt to Assets Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Total Assets

- Percantage of company assets financed by debt

### Debt to Equity Ratio

**Debt to Equity Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Stockholders' Equity

- Compares creditor funding to owner funding

**Stockholders**: like a lot of debt if the company can take advantage of positive financial leverage. Less dilution (hold)

**Creditors**: prefer less debt and more equity because equity represents a buffer of protection.
