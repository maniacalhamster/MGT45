# Chp 6 - Accounting for Long-Term Operational Assets

As opposed to **current assets**, which turn into cash at the end of the accounting period

## 1. Identify different types of long-term operational assets and terminology

- Tangible
  - machines
  - buildings
  - vehicles
  - equipment

- Intangible
  - rights/privileges
  - patents
  - franchises

Both are long-term assets intended to last and provide value for multiple years

### Tangible Long-Term Assets

1. Property, Plant, and Equipment
   - AKA "fixed assets"
   - depreciate over their useful life
2. Natural Resources
   - mineral deposits, oil/gas reserves, etc.
   - depleted over their useful life
3. Land
   - Infinite life
   - Not subject to depreciation

### Depreciationn

- The amount of a tangible assets's cost that is transferred to expense on the income statement from the balance sheet during an accounting period.

- Done on a regular basis

- spreads cost of initial investment as expense to income statement over time 

- intends to match loss of profit generating ability over time

- Inc Expenses, Dec Profit, Generate tax benefit for company
  - Dec "book value" of asset on Balance Sheet

Non-Cash!

- **Straight-Line Method** - same amount of depreciation is taken each accounting period
  - (Asset Cost - Salvageable Value) / (Useful Life)
- **Double-declining Balance** - accelerated produces more deprecation expense in the early years of an asset's life, with declining amount of expense in later years
- **Units-of-Production** - (aka **business metric**) produces varying amount of depreciation in diff accounting periods depending upon the number of units produced
