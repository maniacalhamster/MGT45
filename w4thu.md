## 2. Show how sales tax liabilities affect financial statements

First step: Set up a liability 

- Most states require retail companies to collect sales tax on items sold to their customers
- Retailers then remites or pays the tax tot he state at regular intervals
- In essense, a retailer collects for the tax authority
- Sales tax is a liability to the retailer until paid to the state

Second step: Pay the liability

- Asset use

## 3. Define contingent liabilities and explain how they are reported in financial statements.

**Contingent Liability**: potential obligation arising from a past event. An expense that could be looming

- Judgement needs to be applied: think of a lawsuit against your company

- If you're looking at Financials, a good thing to look for
- If you're about to do business w/ company or potentiallhy working for one --> good idea to check for contingient liabilities

- GAAP req companies classify contingent liabilities into 3 diff categories
  - reflects likelihood of becoming actual liabilities

- Quantified
  - probable and estimate
  - recognize in the financial statements
- On radar
  - Reasonably possible (or probable but not estimable)
- No mention
  - Remote
  - Need not recognize or disclose

Separating principal and interest within payment

Assuming we know the fixed periodic payment amount:
1. ID the unpaid principal balance
2. Amount applied to interest = Unpaid principal balance x Interest rate (usually monthly)
3. Amount applied to principal = Periodic equal fixed payment - amount applied to interest
4. New unpaid principal balance = Unpaid principal balance - amount applied to principal

## 6. Explain how to account for bonds and related interest costs

Context:
- Jan 1, 2012 bonds issued by borrower (Mason Co)
- Principal = $100K from creditors
- Stated interest rate = 9%
- Interest Date = when annual interest payments are due to creditors
  - set to 12/31 each year for 5 years
- Maturity Date = Dec 31, 2016 (end of 5th year); Mason pays off $100K principal

Issuing bond 
- Balance: `Assets.Cash` = `Liabilities.Bonds_Payable` 
- Cash Flow + 

Bond interest expense recognition
- Balance: `(Assets.Cash)` = `(Equity.Ret_Earnings)`
- Income: `Interest Exp` = `(Net Income)`
- Cash Flow -

Pay off Bonds payable liability
- Balance: `(Assets.Cash)` = `(Liabilities.Bonds_Payable)` 
- Cash Flow -
